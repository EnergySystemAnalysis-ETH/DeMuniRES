      A review of mixed-integer linear formulations for framework-based energy system models
    abstract: |
      Optimization-based frameworks for energy system modeling such as TIMES, ETHOS.FINE, or PyPSA have emerged as important tools to outline a cost-efficient energy transition. Consequently, numerous reviews have compared the capabilities and application cases of established energy system optimization frameworks with respect to their model features or adaptability but widely neglect the frameworks’ underlying mathematical structure. This limits its added value for users who not only want to use models but also program them themselves. To address this issue, we follow a hybrid approach by not only reviewing 63 optimization-based frameworks for energy system modeling with a focus on their mathematical implementation but also conducting a meta-review of 68 existing literature reviews. Our work reveals that the basic concept of network-based energy flow optimization has remained the same since the earliest publications in the 1970s. Thereby, the number of open-source available optimization frameworks for energy system modeling has more than doubled in the last ten years, mainly driven by the uptake of energy transition and progress in computer-aided optimization. To go beyond a qualitative discussion, we also define the mathematical formulation for a mixed-integer optimization model comprising all the model features discussed in this work. We thereby aim to facilitate the implementation of future object-oriented frameworks and to increase the comprehensibility of existing ones for energy system modelers.

      Spatio-temporal optimization of a future energy system for power-to-hydrogen applications in Germany
    abstract: |
      Achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets requires an increased share of renewable energy sources in todays energy systems. The spatial and temporal mismatch between electricity supply and consumers demand arising from fluctuating renewable electricity generation can be overcome by energy transport and storage. Here, one option is the Power-to-Gas concept. With this, hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis and can then be flexibly distributed and stored throughout the energy system. In this study, an optimization model is proposed that represents such an energy system as multiple interconnected nodes and which considers the systems time-dependent characteristics in terms of the integration of typical days and their chronological order. This methodology is applied to determine the cost-optimal design and operation of future energy systems for Power-to-Gas scenarios in Germany. In these scenarios, hydrogen is supplied to mobility and industry. Onshore wind turbines and hydrogen pipelines and underground storage facilities are considered for generation, transmission and storage. For all scenarios, a hydrogen cost below the current hydrogen retail price of 9.5 Euro/kg at German fueling stations is obtained. Additionally, the value of hydrogen storage in salt caverns is investigated by prohibiting their construction during optimization, which results in a cost increase of 1.5 Euro/kg.

      A review of approaches to uncertainty assessment in energy system optimization models
    abstract: |
      Energy system optimization models (ESOMs) have been used extensively in providing insights to decision makers on issues related to climate and energy policy. However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, ESOMs tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for ESOMs. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to ESOM type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.

      PyPSA: Python for Power System Analysis
    abstract: |
      Python for Power System Analysis (PyPSA) is a free software toolbox for simulating and optimising modern electrical power systems over multiple periods. PyPSA includes models for conventional generators with unit commitment, variable renewable generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks. It is designed to be easily extensible and to scale well with large networks and long time series. In this paper the basic functionality of PyPSA is described, including the formulation of the full power flow equations and the multi-period optimisation of operation and investment with linear power flow equations. PyPSA is positioned in the existing free software landscape as a bridge between traditional power flow analysis tools for steady-state analysis and full multi-period energy system models. The functionality is demonstrated on two open datasets of the transmission system in Germany (based on SciGRID) and Europe (based on GridKit).

      Resilient Configuration Approach of Integrated Community Energy System Considering Integrated Demand Response Under Uncertainty
    abstract: |
      Integrated community energy system (ICES) enables multi-energy synergy and impulses interaction of integrated demand response (IDR) from the demand side. Nevertheless, the randomness lies in IDR resources and renewable generation in the ICES configuration issue still lacks thorough analysis. Furthermore, the widely focused concern of resiliency urges more proactive consideration of potential emergencies at the planning stage of ICES. To this end, this paper proposed a resilience-oriented stochastic ICES configuration framework considering IDR influence. First, generalized IDR models are set up in detail with elaborate fuzzy feature analysis of price-responsive multi-energy loads. Then, the vulnerability indicators of tie lines and converting devices of the ICES are first introduced to demonstrate the occasional outage in the normal operation and blackout in the emergent case. In addition, the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (WCVaR) theory is innovatively integrated to the traditional risk-neutral model, which is formulated as a two-stage stochastic chance-constrained programming problem, aiming to combine portfolio with minimizing the worst-case cost caused by a disaster. The models are then transformed into mixed-integer linear programming problems via several linearization techniques. Finally, the results of the case studies showed the established model’s superiority in improving the overall economy (reduce 6.94% of the worst-case cost) and system resiliency (decrease the value-at-risk by 3.20%) against an unforeseen hurricane. Meanwhile, the ICES reliability was also improved by declining 25.65% of unintended load curtailment faced with an emergency. The proposed approach provided an efficient preventive portfolio scheme of the IDR-integrated ICES for decision-makers’ different risk preferences of natural hazards.

      Stabilized Benders decomposition for energy planning under climate uncertainty
    abstract: |
      This paper applies Benders decomposition to two-stage stochastic problems for energy planning under climate uncertainty, a key problem for the design of renewable energy systems. To improve performance, we adapt various refinements for Benders decomposition to the problem’s characteristics—a simple continuous master-problem, and few but large sub-problems. The primary focus is stabilization, specifically comparing established bundle methods to a quadratic trust-region approach for continuous problems. An extensive computational comparison shows that all stabilization methods can significantly reduce computation time. However, the quadratic trust-region and the linear box-step method are the most robust and straightforward to implement. When parallelized, the introduced algorithm outperforms the vanilla version of Benders decomposition by a factor of 100. In contrast to off-the-shelf solvers, computation time remains constant when the number of scenarios increases. In conclusion, the algorithm enables robust planning of renewable energy systems with a large number of climatic years. Beyond climate uncertainty, it can make an extensive range of other analyses in energy planning computationally tractable, for instance, endogenous learning and modeling to generate alternatives.

      Modelling to generate near-Pareto-optimal alternatives (MGPA) for the municipal energy transition
    abstract: |
      Energy system models are frequently used to support energy planning. Especially at the local level, however, decision-making is difficult because of conflicting interests of diverse stakeholders. This study proposes a new method to overcome such policy dilemmas and demonstrates it for municipal heat and power planning. Modelling to generate near-Pareto-optimal alternatives (MGPA) is a novel combination of the augmented epsilon-constraint method (AUGMECON) and modelling to generate alternatives (MGA). This approach tackles explicit, easy-to-formulate objectives first before exploring a spectrum of alternatives within a region of interest in a second step. MGPA is implemented in a highly adaptable energy system optimisation framework (Backbone) and applied to two municipalities with heterogeneous demands and renewable potentials. By first generating a Pareto front between cost and CO2 emissions, marginal CO2 abatement costs and their corresponding decarbonisation potentials are identified. Subsequently, near-Pareto-optimal alternatives are generated and technological trade-offs as well as must-haves and must-avoids are discussed. Depending on the local renewable energy potential available, decarbonisation costs at the municipal level can differ by a factor of five. The diversification resulting from the use of MGPA reveals a broad range of viable solutions, for example without large-scale renewable infrastructure or with up to 95% local power autonomy, but switching to heat pumps remains a must-have in both municipalities. We recommend that energy system modellers adopt a combination of such different multi-objective optimisation methods to improve decision support for the energy transition.

      Reviewing local and integrated energy system models: insights into flexibility and robustness challenges
    abstract: |
      The electrification of heating, cooling, and transportation to reach decarbonization targets calls for a rapid expansion of renewable technologies. Due to their decentral and intermittent nature, these technologies require robust planning that considers non-technical constraints and flexibility options to be integrated effectively. Energy system models (ESMs) are frequently used to support decision-makers in this planning process. In this study, 116 case studies of local, integrated ESMs are systematically reviewed to identify best-practice approaches to model flexibility and address non-technical constraints. Within the sample, storage systems and sector coupling are the most common types of flexibility. Sector coupling with the transportation sector is rarely considered, specifically with electric vehicles even though they could be used for smart charging or vehicle-to-grid operation. Social aspects are generally either completely neglected or modeled exogenously. Lacking actor heterogeneity, which can lead to unstable results in optimization models, can be addressed through building-level information. A strong emphasis on cost is found and while emissions are also frequently reported, additional metrics such as imports or the share of renewable generation are nearly entirely absent. To guide future modeling, the paper concludes with a roadmap highlighting flexibility and robustness options that either represent low-hanging fruit or have a large impact on results.

      Combining local preferences with multi-criteria decision analysis and linear optimization to develop feasible energy concepts in small communities
    abstract: |
      Decentralised community energy resources are often abundant in smaller, more rural communities. Such communities often lack the capacity to develop extensive energy concepts and thus to exploit these resources in a consistent way. This paper presents an integrated participatory approach to developing feasible energy concepts for small communities. The novelty lies in the combination of methods, the consideration of uncertainties, and the application to an exemplary municipality in Germany. Stakeholder workshops are combined with energy modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and a high transferability is ensured with mainly public data. The workshop discussion revealed three values: economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, and local energy autonomy. A total of eight alternatives for the 2030 energy system are identified to achieve these values. We find that an alternative that seeks only maximization of economic sustainability should be rejected based on elicited preferences. Instead, several alternatives seeking a maximization of environmental sustainability with constraints on economic sustainability (i.e. total cost) and local energy autonomy consistently achieve the highest overall performance scores. A maximization of economic sustainability or local energy autonomy alone results in the lowest overall performance scores and should therefore not be pursued by the community. The intermediate alternatives demonstrate that an equivalent performance gain with respect to autonomy comes at higher costs than the same gain with respect to environmental sustainability. Similarities between the best performing alternatives in terms of technologies that can be installed by 2030 show that our methodology can generate concrete and robust recommendations on building-level measures for energy system design.

      SpineOpt: A flexible open-source energy system modelling framework
    abstract: |
      The transition towards more sustainable energy systems poses new requirements on energy system models. New challenges include representing more uncertainties, including short-term detail in long-term planning models, allowing for more integration across energy sectors, and dealing with increased model complexities. SpineOpt is a flexible, open-source, energy system modelling framework for performing operational and planning studies, consisting of a wide spectrum of novel tools and functionalities. The most salient features of SpineOpt include a generic data structure, flexible temporal and spatial structures, a comprehensive representation of uncertainties, and model decomposition capabilities to reduce the computational complexity. These enable the implementation of highly diverse case studies. SpineOpt’s features are presented through several publicly-available applications. An illustrative case study presents the impact of different temporal resolutions and stochastic structures in a co-optimised electricity and gas network. Using a lower temporal resolution in different parts of the model leads to a lower computational time (44%–98% reductions), while the total system cost varies only slightly (-1.22–1.39%). This implies that modellers experiencing computational issues should choose a high level of temporal accuracy only when needed.

      Mixed integer linear programing based approach for optimal planning and operation of a smart urban energy network to support the hydrogen economy
    abstract: |
      The future of urban energy systems relies on the transition to “smart energy networks” which incorporate energy storage with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Hydrogen provides a desirable energy vector for both energy storage and exchange of energy between energy hubs within a smart energy network. This paper aims to develop a generic mathematical model for the optimal energy management of future communities where hydrogen is used as an energy vector. An energy hub is a novel concept that systematically and holistically considers the energy requirements of both mobility and stationary loads. In order to perform optimization studies, the minimization of capital cost of hydrogen refueling stations and operation and maintenance cost of all energy hubs within the network are considered. The modeling and optimization are undertaken and carried out in the General Algebraic Modeling Software (GAMS). The case study considers four energy hubs consisting of a commercial building, school, residential complex, as well as hydrogen refueling stations. The study investigates the optimal operation of different energy conversion and storage technologies in order to meet the demand of energy. The results showed that the optimum size of electrolyser and hydrogen tank for supplying the hydrogen demand in the energy hub network is two 290-kW electrolysers and four 30-kg tanks, respectively. The average daily strike price of electricity by which the electrolyser operates is $0.036 per kWh and will not operate when the average hourly Ontario electricity price is higher than $0.13 per kWh. The levelized cost of hydrogen produced by hydrogen refueling station is estimated to be $6.74 per kg. Moreover, the optimal operation of energy conversion and energy storage technologies within each hub and the optimal interaction between energy hubs with in the network are also investigated. In addition, it is shown that distributed hydrogen generation is more preferable than H2 delivery in environmental and economic comparison.

      A taxonomy of models for investigating hydrogen energy systems
    abstract: |
      Hydrogen can serve multiple purposes within the energy system, from flexibility provider, to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, to chemical feedstock. A range of model paradigms have been developed to assess the potential for hydrogen energy systems while accounting for the unique characteristics of hydrogen. This study proposes a taxonomy to classify models of hydrogen energy systems. The taxonomy is based on a review of 29 studies that proposed a taxonomy for energy models in general. This review identified 124 categories that are commonly used to map models, which were grouped into six major categories. This general taxonomy was then adapted to hydrogen, leaving only 32 categories in four major categories. Nine hydrogen archetypes that cover the entire spectrum of studies of hydrogen energy systems were identified. Each of these archetypes was mapped against the categories defined which allowed identifying common gaps across archetypes and degree of interrelationship between them. The environmental and high spatial resolution aspects are only covered by one archetype. The correlation between archetypes assessed in this study can be used to identify opportunities for soft-linking. All the archetypes provide partial answers and using a modeling suite composed of various models could address shortcomings of individual archetypes. All models have a strong focus on technology and costs, with other aspects such as the innovation cycle, market design and policy levers to promote deployment receiving little focus. Capturing these dynamics in the hydrogen archetypes would enable a more holistic analysis and would also facilitate subsequent action.

      Spatio-temporal optimization of a future energy system for power-to-hydrogen applications in Germany
    abstract: |
      Achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets requires an increased share of renewable energy sources in todays energy systems. The spatial and temporal mismatch between electricity supply and consumers demand arising from fluctuating renewable electricity generation can be overcome by energy transport and storage. Here, one option is the Power-to-Gas concept. With this, hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis and can then be flexibly distributed and stored throughout the energy system. In this study, an optimization model is proposed that represents such an energy system as multiple interconnected nodes and which considers the systems time-dependent characteristics in terms of the integration of typical days and their chronological order. This methodology is applied to determine the cost-optimal design and operation of future energy systems for Power-to-Gas scenarios in Germany. In these scenarios, hydrogen is supplied to mobility and industry. Onshore wind turbines and hydrogen pipelines and underground storage facilities are considered for generation, transmission and storage. For all scenarios, a hydrogen cost below the current hydrogen retail price of 9.5 Euro/kg at German fueling stations is obtained. Additionally, the value of hydrogen storage in salt caverns is investigated by prohibiting their construction during optimization, which results in a cost increase of 1.5 Euro/kg.

      Chapter 6 - Hydrogen production via electrolysis: Mathematical modeling approach
    abstract: |
      Scientists have a great orientation to discover, develop, and optimize any kind of renewable energy resources and related systems to extract as much power as possible with reducing carbon emission rather than employing conventional and highly harmful polluters such as fossil fuels. Hydrogen energy is considered a clean and sustainable power source and its production process has received huge attention among numerous researchers. Despite its lower energy density, its advantages like less pollution and environmental impacts, convenient operation, less self-discharge, the competitive cost concerning other renewable resources and a term long lasting override a few drawbacks. Many processes have been suggested for hydrogen production in which electrolysis is very common and pivotally important. There are three main ways to generate hydrogen according to the electrolyzer method: alkaline electrolyzer (AE), proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME), and solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE). In this chapter, the mentioned methods are thoroughly and individually studied in terms of mathematical modeling. Renewable energy resources including solar energy and wind energy for hydrogen production along with their mathematical modeling are also discussed. These systems produce power and fuel simultaneously and scientists mainly focus on efficiency and production amount increment as well as reduction in energy generation cost.

      Modeling for optimal operation of PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers
    abstract: |
      This contribution presents and analyzes modeling and minimum cost operation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and electrolyzers. First, detailed thermoelectric models of the electrochemical technologies based on a first-principle approach are presented. Then, as the detailed nonlinear models developed are intractable for use in online optimal control computation, a mixed integer linear program (MILP) is formulated with a piecewise affine approximation of the conversion efficiency and linear temperature dynamics for the devices. The outputs of the simplified linear models are compared with the detailed ones, when optimally producing and consuming a fixed quantity of hydrogen gas. Comparisons are performed for a variety of price scenarios and efficiency approximations, for both the fuel cell and electrolyzer.

      Modeling and Control of a Renewable Hybrid Energy System With Hydrogen Storage
    abstract: |
      This paper deals with system integration and controller design for power management of a stand-alone renewable energy (RE) hybrid system, which is at the construction stage in Lambton College (Sarnia, ON, Canada). The system consists of five main components: photovoltaic arrays, wind turbine, electrolyzer, hydrogen storage tanks, and fuel cell. The model for each process component is developed, and all the components are integrated in a Matlab/Simulink environment. A two-level control system is implemented, comprising a supervisory controller, which ensures the power balance between intermittent RE generation, energy storage, and dynamic load demand, as well as local controllers for the photovoltaic, wind, electrolyzer, and fuel cell unit. Simulations are performed to document the efficacy of the proposed power management strategy.

      A comparison of storage systems in neighbourhood decentralized energy system applications from 2015 to 2050
    abstract: |
      The potential of both long-term (hydrogen storage) and short-term (batteries and thermal) storage systems in decentralized neighbourhoods are assessed using a multi-objective optimization approach that minimizes both costs and CO2 emissions. A method is developed, which evaluates the performance of long and short-term storage systems in the future based on multi-objective optimization. More specifically, hydrogen storage is investigated for its future potential to be used as a long-term storage in a decentralized context and it is compared with short-term storage systems such as batteries and thermal storage. In order to analyze potential future developments, a scenario approach is deployed based on the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change’s ‘Special Report on Emissions Scenarios’. Three future scenarios are defined and simulated for the years of 2015, 2020, 2035, and 2050 for both a rural and an urban neighbourhood in Switzerland. Based on the scenarios, the energy demand and renewable potential projections until 2050 are simulated including retrofitted buildings and renewable potential in the neighbourhoods. The Pareto front of solutions is then benchmarked against national carbon and energy targets from 2020 until 2050. In addition, a range of parameter assumptions (e.g., for economic variables, policy changes, environmental conditions) are used in each scenario to incorporate uncertainty into the analysis. The long-term storage potential of hydrogen, in particular, is evaluated for its capability to shift renewable surpluses in summer towards demand later in the year. From the results, it is predicted that neighbourhoods with high renewable surpluses (i.e., in rural settings) should consider the advantages of a hydrogen storage system from 2035 to 2050. For neighbourhoods with low surpluses, short-term battery and thermal storage systems are predicted to be sufficient for load shifting. It is also observed that a high feed-in remuneration undermines on-site consumption, thus resulting in lower levels of storage deployment due the selling of production back to the centralized electricity grid. Lastly, it is concluded that both an increase in renewable technology deployment and in the retrofit rate of buildings will both be required to meet energy targets for the two case studies. As the renewable potential in urban contexts is limited, it is particularly important for older building stock to be retrofitted at a high rate (more than 2% of buildings per year) in order to reduce the end energy demand of the buildings. The approach used in this article is widely applicable both in spatial scope (e.g., other decentralized energy systems, geographies) and temporal scope (e.g., different years, scenarios) and allows for an optimization with a range of objective functions, thus making it an effective approach to identify the renewable and storage technologies that can contribute to most of the decarbonization of the building stock in the future.

      Power-to-hydrogen as seasonal energy storage: an uncertainty analysis for optimal design of low-carbon multi-energy systems
    abstract: |
      This study analyzes the factors leading to the deployment of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH2) within the optimal design of district-scale Multi-Energy Systems (MES). To this end, we utilize an optimization framework based on a mixed integer linear program that selects, sizes, and operates technologies in the MES to satisfy electric and thermal demands, while minimizing annual costs and CO2 emissions. We conduct a comprehensive uncertainty analysis that encompasses the entire set of technology (e.g. cost, efficiency, lifetime) and context (e.g. economic, policy, grid carbon footprint) input parameters, as well as various climate-referenced districts (e.g. environmental data and energy demands) at a European-scope. Minimum-emissions MES, with large amounts of renewable energy generation and high ratios of seasonal thermal-to-electrical demand, optimally achieve zero operational CO2 emissions by utilizing PtH2 seasonally to offset the long-term mismatch between renewable generation and energy demand. PtH2 is only used to abate the last 5–10% emissions, and it is installed along with a large battery capacity to maximize renewable self-consumption and completely electrify thermal demand with heat pumps and fuel cells. However, this incurs additional cost. Additionally, we show that ‘traditional’ MES comprised of renewables and short-term energy storage are able to decrease emissions by 90% with manageable cost increases. The impact of uncertainty on the optimal system design reveals that the most influential parameter for PtH2 implementation is (1) heat pump efficiency as it is the main competitor in providing renewable-powered heat in winter. Further, battery (2) capital cost and (3) lifetime prove to be significant as the competing electrical energy storage technology. In the face of policy uncertainties, a CO2 tax shows large potential to reduce emissions in district MES without cost implications. The results illustrate the importance of capturing the dynamics and uncertainties of short- and long-term energy storage technologies for assessing cost and CO2 emissions in optimal MES designs over districts with different geographical scopes.

      Hydrogen energy storage integrated hybrid renewable energy systems: A review analysis for future research directions
    abstract: |
      Hydrogen energy storage systems (HydESS) and their integration with renewable energy sources into the grid have the greatest potential for energy production and storage while controlling grid demand to enhance energy sustainability. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis based on a comprehensive review of the highly cited articles on HydESS to provide a detailed insight into future directions and applications. The study was carried out by using the Scopus database search engine to look for filtered keywords in the HydESS and related research. It can be demonstrated that the HydESS literature expanded rapidly from 2016 to 2021 compared to 2011 to 2015. It is found that 89.17% of published articles explained control and test systems-based methods, whereas 10.83% of publications discuss review assessments. Our analysis of highly cited articles on HydESS highlights several aspects, such as methods and systems, issues, difficulties, and challenges to establishing current constraints and research gaps. This evaluation can enhance operational performance, environmental friendliness, energy savings, uninterrupted power supply service, cost benefits, on-site generation, and adaptability. It would be beneficial for technology development and the growth of the hydESS industry. This study may act as a guideline not only for academics in determining the line of research and generating additional discoveries, but also for the government in formulating financial strategies.

      Building Energy Simulation and Monitoring: A Review of Graphical Data Representation
    abstract: |
      Data visualization has become relevant in the framework of the evolution of big data analysis. Being able to understand data collected in a dynamic, interactive, and personalized way allows for better decisions to be made when optimizing and improving performance. Although its importance is known, there is a gap in the research regarding its design, choice criteria, and uses in the field of building energy consumption. Therefore, this review discusses the state-of-the-art of visualization techniques used in the field of energy performance, in particular by considering two types of building analysis: simulation and monitoring. Likewise, data visualizations are categorized according to goals, level of detail and target users. Visualization tools published in the scientific literature, as well as those currently used in the IoT platforms and visualization software, were analyzed. This overview can be used as a starting point when choosing the most efficient data visualization for a specific type of building energy analysis.

      OSeMOSYS Global, an open-source, open data global electricity system model generator
    abstract: |
      Abstract 
                  This paper describes OSeMOSYS Global, an open-source, open-data model generator for creating global electricity system models for an active global modelling community. This version of the model generator is freely available and can be used to create interconnected electricity system models for both the entire globe and for any geographically diverse subset of the globe. Compared to other existing global models, OSeMOSYS Global allows for full user flexibility in determining the time slice structure and geographic scope of the model and datasets, and is built using the widely used fully open-source OSeMOSYS energy system model. This paper describes the data sources, structure and use of OSeMOSYS Global, and provides illustrative workflow results.

      A guide to writing articles in energy science
    abstract: |
      Energy science addresses key questions of sustainable development. This suggests that energy scientists should communicate their research effectively with readers both from within and outside of the scientific community. In the communication of energy science, however, scientific writing potentially presents a weak link. Here, we address this problem by clarifying the principle conventions for writing articles in energy science. We propose a top-down approach to writing that begins with structuring the article into sections. Each section should, in turn, be structured in and of itself so that readers can: (i) comprehend the scientific context; (ii) grasp the research questions addressed; (iii) verify methods and results; and (iv) understand the significance of the results. Subsequently, authors should ensure clarity of their scientific arguments by: (i) presenting existing information at the beginning of a sentence and new information at the sentence’s end; (ii) articulating action with appropriate verbs, preferably in active voice; (iii) placing statements in positive form; and (iv) using consistent technical terminology. Substantial text revisions constitute an indispensable part of scientific writing and enable authors to make their exposition concise. Following the conventions outlined in this article can make writing easier, more efficient, and enables energy scientists to communicate their research effectively with a wide audience.

      Modeling to generate alternatives: A fuzzy approach
    abstract: |
      Modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) has been proposed as a framework for dealing with complex problems for which there are important unmodeled issues. MGA techniques are designed to provide the analyst (or decision maker) with a set of alternatives that are good with respect to modeled objectives and different from each other. Some of these alternatives may be better than others with respect to the unmodeled issues. Furthermore, by examining a set of different alternatives the analyst may gain insight and understanding. The concept of fuzziness is demonstrated here to be applicable to the MGA framework. The fuzzy approach can increase the flexibility of targets on modeled objectives as well as the flexibility of the original constraints of the model. Illustrations are provided using a linear programming model of a land use planning problem and a mixed integer programming model of a regional wastewater treatment system planning problem.

      Analyse und Optimierung urbaner Energiesysteme - Entwicklung und Anwendung eines übertragbaren Modellierungswerkzeugs zur nachhaltigen Systemgestaltung
    abstract: |
      Viele Städte und Gemeinden sind sich ihrer Bedeutung für das Gelingen der Energiewende bewusst und verfolgen eigene Nachhaltigkeitsziele. Insbesondere in kleineren Gemeinden fehlt es jedoch häufig am nötigen Fachwissen, um bspw. die lokalen Emissionsminderungspotenziale quantifizieren und geeignete Maßnahmenkombinationen zur Erreichung dieser Ziele identifizieren zu können. Daher wurde im Rahmen dieser Arbeit das RE³ASON (Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency Analysis and System OptimizatioN) Modell entwickelt, mit dem für diese Gemeinden automatisierte Analysen, z. B. zur Bestimmung der Energienachfrage und der Potenziale für erneuerbare Energien, durchgeführt werden können. Bei der anschließenden Optimierung des jeweiligen Energiesystems können verschiedene Ziele verfolgt werden – bspw. die Minimierung der diskontierten Systemausgaben unter der Vorgabe zusätzlicher Emissionsminderungsziele. Die Optimierung umfasst dabei sowohl die Investitions- als auch die Einsatzplanung für Energieumwandlungstechnologien auf der Angebots- und Nachfrageseite. Bei der Implementierung dieses Modells kommen verschiedene Methoden, u. a. aus den Bereichen der Geoinformatik, der Strahlungssimulation, der Betriebswirtschaftslehre, des maschinellen Lernens und der gemischt-ganzzahligen linearen Optimierung zum Einsatz. Ein inhaltlicher Schwerpunkt der Arbeit bildet die Bestimmung der Kosten und Potenziale für die Erzeugung von Strom und Wärme durch Photovoltaik-, Windkraft- und Biomasseanlagen. Besonderer Wert wurde auf die Übertragbarkeit der entwickelten Methoden gelegt, damit diese von möglichst vielen Städten und Gemeinden genutzt werden können. Hierfür wurden diverse öffentlich verfügbare und frei zugängliche Datenquellen genutzt und miteinander kombiniert, um die benötigten Eingangsdaten für die Analyse des städtischen Energiesystems zu generieren. Die Anwendung des Modells im Rahmen mehrerer deutscher und internationaler Fallstudien zeigt unter anderem, dass insb. in kleineren Gemeinden bedeutende Potenziale zur Deckung des Energiebedarfs auf Basis erneuerbarer Energien bestehen. Weiterhin zeigt sich, dass die Umgestaltung des städtischen Energiesystems auf die Nutzung lokaler und nachhaltiger Energieressourcen auch aus Sicht der Gemeindevertreter die zu bevorzugende Alternative darstellen kann. Aus diesen Ergebnissen lassen sich schließlich Handlungsempfehlungen für städtische Entscheidungsträger ableiten. Kritisch anzumerken ist, dass die Modellergebnisse aufgrund der gewählten Systemgrenze keine nationalen energiewirtschaftlichen Schlussfolgerungen zulassen.
